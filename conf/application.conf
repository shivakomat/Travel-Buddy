# This is the main configuration file for the application.
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ConfigFile
# ~~~~~
# Play uses HOCON as its configuration file format.  HOCON has a number
# of advantages over other config formats, but there are two things that
# can be used when modifying settings.
#
# You can include other configuration files in this main application.conf file:
#include "extra-config.conf"
#
# You can declare variables and substitute for them:
#mykey = ${some.value}
#
# And if an environment variable exists when there is no other subsitution, then
# HOCON will fall back to substituting environment variable:
#mykey = ${JAVA_HOME}

## Secret key
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to sign Play's session cookie.
# This must be changed for production, but we don't recommend you change it in this file.
play.http.secret.key = "travel-buddiee"

play.allowGlobalApplication = true

## Evolutions
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# Evolutions allows database scripts to be automatically run on startup in dev mode
# for database migrations. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += evolutions
#
play.evolutions {
  # You can disable evolutions for a specific datasource if necessary
  #db.default.enabled = false
}

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"

# Assets configuration
# ~~~~~

    hikaricp.maximumPoolSize = ${fixedConnectionPool}
  }
